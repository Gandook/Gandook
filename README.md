## Introduction

Hello and welcome to my GitHub page!

I am an ambitious and hardworking programmer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, achieving excellent grades. I am already familiar with Go, SQL, Python, Rust, C++, and Java, and I have been programming since middle school. I am also comfortable with Linux, Shell scripts, Git, CI/CD, and Kubernetes. So far, I have had two years of work experience as a software tester. I love challenging tasks that teach me new things, but I am also resilient enough to complete those that are not enjoyable.
